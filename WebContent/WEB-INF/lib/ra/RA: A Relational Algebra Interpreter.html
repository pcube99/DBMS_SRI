<h1>RA: A Relational Algebra Interpreter</h1>
</center>

<hr>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>RA is a simple relational algebra interpreter written in Java.  It
is built on top of an SQL-based relational database system.  It
implements relational algebra queries by translating them into SQL
queries and executing them on the underlying database system through
JDBC.  RA is packaged with SQLiteJDBC, so you can use RA as a
standalone relational-algebra database system.  Alternatively, you
can use RA as a relational-algebra frontend to other database
systems.</p>

<h3>Getting RA</h3>

<p>The current version of RA is 2.2b (released Aug. 15, 2014).  You can
download one of the following:

</p><ul>

<li>A <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra2/ra-2.2b.tgz">.tar.gz</a> file with everything
including source code.</li>

<li>A <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra2/ra-2.2b.zip">.zip</a> file with everything including
source code.</li>

<li>Just the <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra2/ra.jar">.jar</a> file.  But we also recommend
you download <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra2/sample.db">sample.db</a> (sample SQLite
database), <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra2/sample.properties">sample.properties</a> (RA
connection properties file), and <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra2/sample.ra">sample.ra</a>
(RA script for creating/restoring the sample database), and put them
in the same directory as the .jar file.</li>

</ul>

Or follow the <a href="https://github.com/junyang/RA">project</a> on
GitHub!<p></p>

<h3>Using RA</h3>

<p>To run RA, just type "<tt>java -jar ra.jar</tt>" in the
directory containing <tt>ra.jar</tt>.  RA will then by default run on
the SQLite database file <tt>sample.db</tt> (on which query examples
below are based).  To see more options of running RA, type
"<tt>java -jar ra.jar -h</tt>".  Options <tt>-i</tt> (read
commands/queries from a file), <tt>-o</tt> (log output to a file),
and <tt>-v</tt> (turn on verbose mode) are all pretty useful.</p>

<p>If you want to connect to another database or a different database
system, you will find it convenient to write a connection properties
file of your own.  An example is the file <tt>sample.properties</tt>.
Once you have rolled your own properties file, say <tt><i>PROP_FILE</i></tt>,
run RA using "<tt>java -jar ra.jar <i>PROP_FILE</i></tt>";
add <tt>-P</tt> if you prefer typing your password at runtime instead of
storing it in the properties file.</p>

<p>Once you are in RA, you will see the <tt>ra&gt;</tt> prompt.  For
help, type <tt>\help;</tt>.  You exit RA by issuing the
<tt>\quit;</tt> command.  Use the <tt>\list;</tt> command to see what
relations are available for query in your database.</p>

<ul>

<li><i>ADVANCED USERS:</i> Using
<tt>\sqlexec_{<i>statement</i>};</tt>, you can send an SQL command to
the underlying database.  This command allows you to manipulate the
database in ways (e.g., updating it) that you cannot with just
relational algebra.  For example, the SQLite database file
<tt>sample.db</tt> was in fact created by running "<tt>java -jar
ra.jar sample.properties -i sample.ra</tt>", where
<tt>sample.ra</tt> makes heavy use of <tt>\sqlexec</tt>.</li>

</ul>

<p>RA supports command-line input history and editing using arrow
keys: Up/Down recall previous/next lines, and Left/Right move within
the current line.</p>

<p>The simplest relational query you can write is one that returns
the content of a relation: Just type <tt><i>relName</i>;</tt>, where
<tt><i>relName</i></tt> is the name of the relation.  Note that every
command/operator should start with a backslash (<tt>\</tt>), and
every query/command should be terminated by a semicolon
(<tt>;</tt>).</p>

<p>For most database systems that RA runs on (except MySQL),
relation and attribute names are case-insensitive per SQL standard.
For example, <tt>drink</tt> is just as good as <tt>DRINK</tt>.
Attributes can be of a variety of types.  Details are not
important; just beware that types such as <tt>INTEGER</tt>,
<tt>SMALLINT</tt>, <tt>FLOAT</tt>, <tt>REAL</tt>, <tt>DOUBLE</tt>,
<tt>DECIMAL</tt>, <tt>NUMERIC</tt> are for numbers, and <tt>CHAR</tt>
and <tt>VARCHAR</tt> are for strings.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a complex query, which returns beers liked
by those drinkers who do not frequent James Joyce Pub:
</p><pre>\project_{beer} (

  ((\project_{name}          // all drinkers
     Drinker)
   \diff
   (\rename_{name}           // rename so we can diff
      \project_{drinker}     // drinkers who frequent JJP
        \select_{bar = 'James Joyce Pub'}
          Frequents))

  \join_{drinker = name}     /* join with Likes to find beers */

  Likes

);
</pre>
The syntax is insensitive to white space, and it is fine to enter a
query on multiple lines; RA will number the lines (beyond the first
one) you enter for the current query.  C/C++/Java-style comments
(<tt>//</tt> and <tt>/*...*/</tt>) are supported.<p></p>

<p>RA supports the following relational algebra operators:

</p><ul>

<li><tt>\select_{<i>cond</i>}</tt> is the relational selection
operator.  For example, to select <tt>Drinker</tt> tuples with name
Amy or Ben, we can write <tt>\select_{name = 'Amy' or name = 'Ben'}
Drinker;</tt>.  Syntax for <i>cond</i> follows SQL.  Note that string
literals should be enclosed in <b><i>single</i></b> quotes, and you
may use boolean operators <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and
<tt>not</tt>.  Comparison operators <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>,
<tt>=</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt>, and <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> work
on both string and numeric types.  For string match you can use the
SQL <tt>LIKE</tt> operator; e.g., <tt>\select_{name like 'A%'}
drinker;</tt> finds all drinkers whose name start with A, as
<tt>%</tt> is a wildcard character that matches any number of
characters.</li>

<li><tt>\project_{<i>attr_list</i>}</tt> is the relational projection
operator, where <tt><i>attr_list</i></tt> is a comma-separated list
of attribute names.  For example, to find out what beers are served
by Talk of the Town (but without the price information), we can write
<tt>\project_{bar, beer} (\select_{bar = 'Talk of the Town'}
Serves);</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>\join_{<i>cond</i>}</tt> is the relational theta-join
operator.  For example, to join <tt>Drinker(name, address)</tt> and
<tt>Frequents(drinker, bar, times_a_week)</tt> relations together
using drinker name, we can write <tt>Drinker \join_{name = drinker}
Frequents;</tt>.  Syntax for <i>cond</i> again follows SQL; see notes
on <tt>\select</tt> for more details.</li>

<li><tt>\join</tt> is the relational natural join operator.  For
example, to join <tt>Drinker(name, address)</tt> and
<tt>Frequents(drinker, bar, times_a_week)</tt> relations together
using drinker name, we can write <tt>Drinker \join \rename_{name,
bar, times_a_week} Frequents;</tt>.  Natural join will automatically
equate all pairs of identically named attributes from its inputs (in
this case, <tt>name</tt>), and output only one attribute per pair.
Here we use <tt>\rename</tt> to create two <tt>name</tt> attributes
for the natural join; see notes on <tt>\rename</tt> below for more
details.</li>

<li><tt>\cross</tt> is the relational cross product operator.  For
example, to compute the cross product of <tt>Drinker</tt> and
<tt>Frequents</tt>, we can write <tt>Drinker \cross
Frequents;</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>\union</tt>, <tt>\diff</tt>, and <tt>\intersect</tt> are the
relational union, difference, and intersect operators.  For a trivial
example, to compute the union, difference, and intersection between
<tt>Drinker</tt> and itself, we can write <tt>Drinker \union
Drinker;</tt>, <tt>Drinker \diff Drinker;</tt>, and <tt>Drinker
\intersect Drinker;</tt>, which would return <tt>Drinker</tt> itself,
an empty relation, and <tt>Drinker</tt> itself, respectively.</li>

<li><tt>\rename_{<i>new_attr_name_list</i>}</tt> is the relational
rename operator, where <tt><i>new_attr_name_list</i></tt> is a
comma-separated list of new names, one for each attribute of the
input relation.  For example, to rename the attributes of relation
<tt>Drinker</tt> and compute the cross product of <tt>Drinker</tt>
and itself, we can write <tt>\rename_{name1, address1} Drinker \cross
\rename_{name2, address2} Drinker;</tt>.</li>

</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Known Issues/Limitations</h3>

<ul>

<li><tt>\rename</tt> only supports renaming of attributes; it does
not support renaming of the input relation.</li>

<li><tt>\union</tt>, <tt>\diff</tt>, and <tt>\intersect</tt> check
the compatibility of input relations by checking the types of each
pair of attributes in the order they appear in the input relations.
Therefore, <tt>(\project_{name, address} Drinker) \diff
(\project_{address, name} Drinker)</tt> will not return an empty
table, because the ordering of attributes is important.  This
behavior is consistant with SQL (which departs from the
"purest" relational model where the ordering of attributes
is unimportant).

</li><li>Error messages may not be especially meaningful.  Recall that RA
translates relational algebra expressions into SQL queries.  RA
expressions with ill-formed selection/join conditions or attribute
name lists simply result in incorrect SQL queries.  In these cases,
RA just passes back the error messages from the underlying database
system, without attempting to create RA-specific messages.</li>

<li>For some database systems, RA does not allow a relational algebra
expression (or subexpression) to produce a result relation with
identically named attributes, because these attributes cannot be
distinguished.  Depending on the underlying database system, you may
get an error message like <i>column "name" specified more
than once</i> (from PostgreSQL), or <i>the statement does not include
a required column list</i> (from DB2).<br>

In particular, <tt>\cross</tt> and <tt>\join_{<i>cond</i>}</tt>
(theta-join) do not allow input relations with identically named
attributes.  For example, <tt>Drinker \cross Drinker;</tt> is illegal
because it would generate a relation with two <tt>name</tt> and two
<tt>address</tt> attributes.  Therefore, the attributes need to be
renamed before the cross product.  Also, <tt>\project</tt> cannot
output the same attribute more than once.<br>

SQLite has no problem with identically named attributes, because
it automatically assigns attributes different names.</li>

<li>As a general rule, RA may signal an error whenever it has trouble
determining how to name the attributes of a result relation.  This
behavior is database-dependent.<br>

For example, consider <tt>Bar \union Beer;</tt>.  Never mind what
this query means, but it is arguably legal because both relations
have two attributes with compatible string types.  PostgreSQL,
SQLite, and MySQL have no problem with this query, but DB2 will
complain that their attribute names are different.  In any case,
<tt>\rename_{A, B} Bar \union \rename_{A, B} Beer;</tt> will always
work.  Also, <tt>\project_{price+1} Serves</tt> does not work on DB2,
not because it does not support arithmetic operators, but because RA
does not know how to name the resulting attribute.  On the other
hand, PostgreSQL will accept this query and assign a default
attribute name <tt>?column?</tt>, though it will still bark at
<tt>\project_{price+1, price+2} Serves</tt>.  SQLite and MySQL
happily take both, by automatically assigning different names to
output attributes.</li>
